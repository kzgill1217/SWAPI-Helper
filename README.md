# SWAPI-Helper
A refactoring of cfjedimaster's Star War's API wrapper using Axios and jQuery

Please refer to cfjedimaster's SWAPI-Wrapper for further instructions on how to use the functions
https://github.com/cfjedimaster/SWAPI-Wrapper

## How To Use
1. Copy the swapiHelper.js in the lib folder and simply include it into your projects directory
2. Use the aliases in the bottom of the helper file to refer to the functions
3. Use the request function to just get the response of a url

### TO-DO
1. Use jQuery to pass object in as a parameter to a single request generator function and pass in variables in the code to remove the use of so many aliases
2. Update README on using that function
3. Create a minified version of the SWAPI Helper
4. Turn SWAPI Helper into an npm package
